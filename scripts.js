//step 3: opening index.html in browser displays all "answer"'s correctly and results in expected final value of 42.
//step 4: changing the first step to add 1 and 1 together results in failure at js:11 because the value becomes a negative number at this point and slowMath promises are written to throw errors is negative numbers are involved.
