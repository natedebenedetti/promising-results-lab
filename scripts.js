// step 2: Create promise chain using slow math.

slowMath.add(6, 2).then((answer) => { //all of the console logs will wait 1 second to log due to slow math's promises being written with a setTimeout of 1000.

}).catch((error) => { // provides a catch to handle any errors that may arise.
    console.log(error); // logs the error to the console.
});
//step 3: opening index.html in browser displays all "answer"'s correctly and results in expected final value of 42.
//step 4: changing the first step to add 1 and 1 together results in failure at js:11 because the value becomes a negative number at this point and slowMath promises are written to throw errors is negative numbers are involved.
